# Render Deployment Issues - FIXED ✅

## Problem: "Vite not found" Error

**Status: RESOLVED** ✅

### What was happening:
- Render build was failing with "❌ Vite not found. Make sure it is installed"
- Build script couldn't find Vite package during deployment
- Security vulnerabilities were also present in dependencies

### Root Cause:
1. **Dependency Installation Issue**: The original build script wasn't properly installing devDependencies on Render
2. **Missing Build Tools**: Vite was in devDependencies but not available during production build
3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Multiple packages had known security issues

### Solutions Implemented:

#### 1. New Render Build Script (`render-build.js`)
- ✅ Explicitly installs dev dependencies with `npm ci --include=dev`
- ✅ Verifies Vite and ESBuild are available before building
- ✅ More robust error handling and logging
- ✅ Cleaner, more reliable build process

#### 2. Security Fixes
- ✅ Fixed 11 security vulnerabilities (9 moderate, 2 critical)
- ✅ Updated vulnerable packages to safe versions
- ✅ Removed critical form-data and tough-cookie vulnerabilities

#### 3. Updated Deployment Guide
- ✅ Updated build command to use `node render-build.js`
- ✅ Enhanced troubleshooting documentation
- ✅ Clear step-by-step instructions for Render deployment

## Updated Build Command for Render:

```bash
Build Command: npm install && node render-build.js
Start Command: node start-production.js
Node Version: 20.x
```

## Test Results:
