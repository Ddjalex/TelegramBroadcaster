# ðŸ”§ RENDER CONFIG CONFLICT - FIXED

## Problem
Vite was still trying to load the existing `vite.config.ts` file, causing module resolution errors.

## âœ… Solution

Created `render-build-no-config.sh` that completely avoids config file conflicts.

### Update Your Render Settings:

**Build Command:**
```bash
chmod +x render-build-no-config.sh && ./render-build-no-config.sh
```

**Start Command:**
```bash
node dist/index.js
```

### How This Fixes The Issue:
1. Temporarily renames existing `vite.config.ts` to avoid conflicts
2. Uses inline Vite configuration via stdin
3. Restores original config after build
4. Creates admin user with CommonJS script (no ES module issues)
5. Comprehensive verification of admin user creation

### Expected Success Output:
```
âœ… Database connection successful
âœ… ADMIN USER CREATED: admin/admin123
âœ… Admin user verified and ready for login
ðŸŽ‰ DEPLOYMENT READY - LOGIN WILL WORK!
```

This completely eliminates the Vite config conflict and ensures your admin user is created properly.

**Login Credentials:** admin/admin123
