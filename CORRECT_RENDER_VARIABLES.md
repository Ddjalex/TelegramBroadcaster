# CRITICAL: Render Deployment Configuration

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Your Render build command is WRONG

Based on the error log you shared, Render is still using the old build command that fails with dependency conflicts.

### ❌ Current (Broken) Render Settings:
```
Build Command: npm install && npm run build
```

### ✅ CORRECT Render Settings:
```
Build Command: chmod +x render-build-final.sh && ./render-build-final.sh
Start Command: node start-production.js
Node Version: 20.x
```

## How to Fix in Render:

1. **Go to your Render service dashboard**
2. **Click "Settings" tab**
3. **Update Build Command to**: `chmod +x render-build-final.sh && ./render-build-final.sh`
4. **Save changes**
5. **Trigger manual deploy**

## Why This Fixes the Error:

The error you're seeing happens because:
- `npm install` has dependency conflicts (Vite 7.0.6 vs @types/node versions)
- Our bash script uses `--legacy-peer-deps` to bypass these conflicts
- The bash script installs missing build tools automatically

## Verification:

After updating the build command, you should see this in Render logs:
```
✅ BUILD COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!
Frontend: dist/public/
Backend: dist/index.js
```

Instead of the ERESOLVE errors you're currently getting.
